1. Unpack "scholar_log.sql.zip" to get "scholar_log.sql"
2. Directly import the "scholar_log.sql" into a MySQL database (A schema named "scholar_log" with a single table named "all_errors" will be generated. There are about 1.5 million records in the table, so the import can take quite a while to complete)
3. Open "code/idt_files/php/db.php" and change db parameters following the comments.
4. Drop "code" to a web server that supports PHP and grant proper access to it.
5. Use the tool by visiting the URL that points to "code/index.html".
